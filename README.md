# Statiscal Methods in Aritifical Intelligence
Machine Learning Assignments During the Course

## Assignment 1 contents:

### 1.  KNN Classifier (Scratch)
        Implemented a KNN Classifier from scratch for all values of K and different distance measures.
        Trained and tested the classifier using MNIST dataset and reported all the metrics.
        Compared the classifier with the scikit-learn's built-in KNN classifier.
        
       Used the same classifier on the Mushroom dataset.
       Used plots to show how the missing data is handled.
       
### 2. Decision Tree Classifier (Scratch)
        Implemented Decision Tree Classifier from scratch to predict housing prices (attributes - numeric+categorical).
        Normalized data and used variance reduction as the criterion for choosing split in the decision tree.
        Reported metrics such as MSE and MAE and compared the classifier with scikit-learn's built-in Decision Tree Classifier
        
        

## Assignment 2  contents:

### 1.  Linear SVM (Scratch)
        Implemented a Linear SVM Classifier from scratch for prediction of test images on CiFAR dataset.
        Ipynb file contains a brief description of SVM and its parameter (eg. significance of C)
        Compared the classifier with the scikit-learn's built-in KNN classifier and reported the support vectors.
        
### 2. Guassian Mixture Models Clustering
       
### 3. Linear Regression Model (Scratch)
        Implemented Linear Regression Model from scratch to predict apparent temperature in the given dataset of historical weather..
        Reported metrics such as MSE and MAE and reported the behavior of the model on different regression coefficients. 
        Used different plots to show the change in MSE and MAE for different number of iterations in conditions like:
                a. Different coefficient values for a fixed learning parameter.
                b. Different learning parammter values for a fixed coefficient value.
      
### 4. KMeans Clustering (Scratch)
        Implemented KMeans Clustering from scratch for clustering the given dataset of documents from 5 different fields
        Used pretrained model and vectorizers (eg TF-IDF) for feature extraction from the documents
